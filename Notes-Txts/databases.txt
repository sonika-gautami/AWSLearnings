DynamoDb:
fully managed
fast & low latency performance
400 kb data size

tables
items
attributes


Primary Key:
    Partiton Key  + Sort Key
    (Hash)          (Range)

    If Partition(Hash) Key can uniquelly identifiers the record, Sort(Range) Key is not required.

One or more secondary indexes

maximize your thoughput, by
    ditributing requests across full range of partition keys.
The keys should be distributed so as if there is mutiple rewuests coming
    they are of diff partition keys.

Read Capacity
Write Capacity

capacity units -> size of units

Dynamo db scaling -> clouwatch alarms

the provisioned thoughput is distributed evenly on each partion of the table.
(there is no sharing of thoughput among different partitons)

per partition limits:
     - 10 GB max
     - 3000 read capacity
     - 1000 write capacity
