Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

> within a single AWS region
> across several instances in multiple availability zones

> if need load balancing across regions, then use Route 53 instead elb
  If the primary region goes down, Route 53 fails over to the secondary region.

> scale horizontally [Adding instances]
> scale vertically	 [Increasing ec2 size]


ELB:
> continuosly checks the health of instance
> directs trffic to healthy instance
> If a healthy instance comes online, then the ELB recognizes the instance
  and routes traffic to it.

ELB with AutoScaling:
> enabling load balacing across new instances


Load Balancer Types:
> internal
> internet facing

> assign Security Groups to ELB (else default SG of VPC will be used)
> SSL termination also supported in ELB
