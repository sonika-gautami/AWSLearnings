//Questions for choosing ec2-instance:
	Duration of instance required?
	High performance storage?
	dedicated or shared tenancy?
	compute intensive OR memory intensive processing?
	scalability?
	availability?
	networking requirements?

//Three distinct purchasing options available for provisioning the AWS EC2 instances:
//1. On-demand instances: (default purchasing option)
> billed on an hourly basis and no upfront payments are required.
> Applications with "unpredictable workloads" or "short-duration" requirements are best handled 

//2. Spot instances:
> There are no upfront costs for provisioning spot instances, and the costs are typically much lower than the on-demand instances.
> The provisioning is done through a bidding process. If you lose the bid, you will not get the EC2 instances.
> Applications that are "viable only at very low compute prices" are a good use case

//3. Reserved instances:
> These instances can be 50â€“60% cheaper than on-demand instances.
> This option is available for 1 and 3 year plans.
> Applications with "predictable workloads" that require compute instances "for longer durations" are a good for using reserved instances.
	


//Instance Types:
	general purpose
	memory intensive
	compute intensive
	storage intensive (EBS optimized instances)
	GPU instances
	


//Tenancy (At VPC or Instance level)
> once selected, can't change.	

//1. dedicated
> AWS provisions your instance on dedicated hardware.
> These instances are isolated from instances created using the shared tenancy option and instances created by other tenants.

//2. shared
> shared hardware	

> Why choose dediacted:
  - high performance or meet compliance requirements or to just avoid noisy neighbors



//EBS based OR instance storage based instances:
//1. EBS based:
> the root device for an instance launched using an AMI is an Amazon EBS volume
> you may or may not choose to use the instance's storage devices.
> can change the instance size
> can top the instances to stop billing.
> automatically replicated within its availability zone to protect against component failures.
> attach as many EBS as needed
> one EBS volume to one ec2 at a time [detach from one then attach to another]

//2. instance storage based:
> disks that are physically attached to the host computer.
> any data stored on it will be lost after a restart of the instance.

> the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume
> can't stop these instances. we can only terminate them.
> can't change the size of instance, once created.


ec2 ---------------------> EBS (persisted separately) 
     NAS (connected via)

NAS -> Network Attached Storage

Encrypt this volume checkbox > when creating EBS volume from AWS console.



//EC2-Classic & EC2-VPC
> If you created your AWS account after 2013-12-04, then only EC2-VPC is supported.




//EC2 instances can be grouped using placement groups.
> instances requiring low latency and high bandwidth communication can be placed in the same placement group.
> When instances are placed in this placement group, they have access to low latency, non- blocking 10 Gbps networking when communicating with other instances in the placement group (within a single availability zone).
> AWS recommends launching all the instances within the cluster placement group at the same time.
